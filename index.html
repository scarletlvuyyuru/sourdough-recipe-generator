<h3 >Instructions:</h3>
Prepare the Dough:
<br/>
In a large bowl, mix the flour and water. Stir until there are no dry bits of flour left. This is called the autolyse stage, where the flour absorbs the water and begins to hydrate. Let it sit for 30 minutes.
<br/>
Add the Starter & Salt:
After the autolyse, add your active sourdough starter and salt to the dough. Mix well until incorporated. The dough will be sticky at this stage.
<br/>
Kneading:
Knead the dough in the bowl or on a lightly floured surface for about 8-10 minutes. Alternatively, you can do a series of stretch and folds every 30 minutes during the first couple of hours of proofing (a total of 4-6 times).
<br/>
Bulk Fermentation:
After kneading, cover the bowl with a damp towel or plastic wrap. Let the dough rise at room temperature for about 4-6 hours, or until it has doubled in size. The dough should have visible bubbles and a slightly domed top. If it’s warmer, it will rise faster.
<br/>
Shape the Dough:
Once the dough has risen, gently turn it out onto a floured surface. Shape it into a round or oval loaf. This can be done by folding the edges toward the center and then flipping the dough over to tighten the surface.
<br/>
Proofing:
Place the shaped dough into a well-floured proofing basket or bowl. Cover it and let it proof for 2-4 hours at room temperature, or refrigerate it for an overnight proof (this enhances the flavor).
<br/>
Preheat the Oven:
While the dough is proofing, preheat your oven to 450°F (230°C). If you have a Dutch oven, place it in the oven as it preheats.
<br/>
Baking:
Once the dough has proofed, carefully turn it out onto parchment paper or a floured peel. If using a Dutch oven, carefully place the dough into the hot pot. If not, you can place it directly on a baking stone or sheet.
Score the top of the dough with a sharp knife or bread lame to allow it to expand while baking.
Cover the Dutch oven with its lid and bake for 20 minutes. Then, remove the lid and bake for another 20-25 minutes until the crust is golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom.
If you don’t use a Dutch oven, place a pan of hot water in the oven during the first 10 minutes of baking to create steam, which helps develop a crisp crust.
Cool and Enjoy:

Let the bread cool completely on a wire rack before slicing. Sourdough bread needs to cool for about an hour to fully set before slicing.
